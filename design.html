Battery <br>
Utilibot will be using lithium batteries as they provide lasting battery life which is necessary
for Utilibot to function properly. <br>
Programming <br>
Utilibot will be coded with Python. Python is a fast programming language that can be used to code
complex programs with user-friendly data structures. <br>
Materials <br>
Aluminum and Steel will be the main material for Utilibot. Utilibot has many features that involve 
dangerous environments so a stronger structure would be necessary for the robot to function. <br>
Cost <br>
The cost for the robot is estimated to be around $10,000. Utilibot will be programmed to do various tasks 
but is incapable of acting on its own. Thus, the cost was decided based on the materials and the tasks 
that the robot would be programmed to do. <br>
